	<h1>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</h1>
	<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Ahoy hoy? What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</p>
	<p>Me fail English? That's unpossible. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! D'oh. <strong> Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</strong> <em> Can't you people take the law into your own hands?</em> I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
	<h2>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals...except the weasel.</h2>
	<p>I didn't get rich by signing checks. I stand by my racial slur. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman - and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</li><li>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</li><li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>

      <h3>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</h3>
      <p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p>

	<li>You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</li><li>Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</li><li>Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</li>

	<p>I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. I hope I didn't brain my damage. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>
	<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>
	<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. I've done everything the Bible says - even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</p>
	<p>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</p>
	<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</p>
	<p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power...like God must feel when he's holding a gun. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</p>
	<p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. I stand by my racial slur.</p>
	<p>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like...love!</p>
	<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the...uh...what cures cancer? Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
	<p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman - and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</p>
	<p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! You don't win friends with salad. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO!</p>
